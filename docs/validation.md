# Validation and evidence boundaries

Start from a clean checkout with Node 24 and `pnpm@10.0.0`:

```sh
pnpm run foliate:submodule:bootstrap
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm run foliate:runtime:stage
pnpm run foliate:runtime:check
```

The bootstrap pins Foliate at `78914aef4466eb960965702401634c2cb348e9b1` on the
reviewed local branch. A default detached submodule checkout fails the gate.
Never bypass an unavailable runtime/security gate by weakening the CSP or bridge.

## Local checks

```sh
pnpm run typecheck
pnpm run lint
pnpm run format:check
pnpm run fixtures:check
node --test scripts/fixture-corpus.test.mjs
pnpm --filter @hamster-note/native-reader exec jest --config ../../jest.config.cjs --rootDir . --runInBand
pnpm --filter @hamster-note/native-reader-demo test --runInBand
```

Focused Jest covers format detection, error categories, models, accessible flow
controls, bridge schemas, timeout/replacement cleanup, and native source helpers.
Helpers and mocked native gates are not proof of native transfer or rendering.
The removed source-string runtime assertions are replaced by the public-control
and authenticated-message tests in `NativeReader.web.test.tsx`, including
linear chapter navigation in both flows and read/render timeouts.

## Browser baseline and measurements

```sh
pnpm run e2e:web:install
pnpm run e2e:web --workers=2
pnpm run smoke:large
pnpm run smoke:large:io
pnpm run dev:web
```

Playwright first syncs/checks the runtime, exports the Demo, verifies exported
assets, and serves that export locally. Chromium uses the full Chrome for
Testing executable (`channel: chromium`); Firefox is a fail-closed check only.
Browser-specific skips are expected and are not acceptance passes. Reports live
in `playwright-report/` and `test-results/`. Runtime-asset abort/404 cases record
source-I/O and renderer counters, distinct from unsupported-browser errors.

`smoke:large` writes `test-results/large-fixture-smoke.json` with actual browser
open/navigation outcomes for EPUB, MOBI, KF8/AZW3, FB2, FBZ, and CBZ. Each entry
records fixture identity, hash, byte size, elapsed measurements, and failure
stage. Every input is recorded even after a failed open; failures fail the run.
Navigation means one forward page/section, not a complete book traversal.
There is no performance threshold or fabricated memory measurement. The separate
`smoke:large:io` report measures only host file reads and SHA-256.

`dev:web` runs `expo start --web`; static export does not establish development
server behavior. Record that smoke separately. The probe's trusted control
canaries must be allowed to run so a negative result is meaningful. Do not
disable all networking and claim the publication policy blocked requests.

## Native build evidence

```sh
pnpm run bundle:ios
pnpm run bundle:android
pnpm run test:native-export
```

Both commands validate/stage the pinned Foliate assets before Expo export and
include the platform secure-host JavaScript integration. They run on Linux.
The export source map must contain the native entry, capability/bridge, and
platform secure-WebView module and must exclude the Web adapter. A successful
Expo exit alone is insufficient: the former directory alias silently selected
`index.web.ts` in native exports. The Demo now resolves its public source entry
with Metro's platform resolution, and each export command verifies its graph.
They do not compile/install the native module or execute WKWebView/Android
WebView. Native 4A/4B platform proof, 4C transfer, 4D rendering, and 4E lifecycle
remain separate. Complete the physical-device records only from actual runs.

## Package and release gates

```sh
pnpm --filter @hamster-note/native-reader run test:release-safety
pnpm --filter @hamster-note/native-reader run test:foliate-runtime-package
pnpm --filter @hamster-note/native-reader run test:package
pnpm --filter @hamster-note/native-reader run release:verify
pnpm run verify
openspec validate --all --strict
```

The package wrappers isolate staging/packing and preserve the source tree.
Packed-consumer sync/check/export, platform compiler/consumer verification, and
the complete package raw gate must be recorded individually. A partial gate or
a failed environment is not a formal infrastructure exception. Do not manually
pack the source tree or omit its safety checks to get a passing result.

Release still requires real branded Edge blocked-canary evidence, real macOS
Safari unsupported/zero-publication-I/O evidence, the separately recorded iOS
evidence or narrowly scoped prior waiver, native platform evidence, and retired
engine removal. Playwright WebKit is not Safari. Prior iOS waiver is neither
a pass nor permission to bypass native pre-source gates or omit implementation.
Use the active change's latest verification report for results and blockers.

`pnpm run supply-chain:check` scans project manifests, locks, patches and source,
checks the pinned submodule, and verifies both generated runtime manifests.
Only historical OpenSpec records, exact change-name documentation pointers, and
the named rejection checks may mention retired engines. Those checks cannot
import a retired engine. `pnpm run test:supply-chain` injects forbidden
dependencies, imports, payloads and revision/hash faults. The complete package
gate also scans each consumer's actual installed tarball tree.

The removed core template tests do not provide Foliate security evidence. Their
bridge and lifecycle responsibilities now belong to the shared wire corpus,
`NativeReader.appState.test.tsx`, generated bootstrap tests, and native fault
matrices. Publication template/transfer behavior remains unverified until the
ordered 4C/4D implementation and real platform gates complete.
